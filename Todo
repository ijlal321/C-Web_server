// CHeck if a client with same private key exists before accepting connection.


// all error printing will be done at heighest level only

// fix n chuks per file max + cleanup

code cleanup + error handling + proper communication.
browser download fix. Index db. 

only then we will move to webrtc

after that we may move to reallly Oloo fast mode

// ====================

// What I was doing ? 
MAKE BOTH WAY FILE UPLOAD DOWNLOAD.
CHUNKS CLEAN UP. IMMEDIATE WHEN NOT NEEDED FOR NOW.2



//  ===============
real todo

1. client send a public name when connecting.
2. Check if client already exist with this private ID. 
(so reconnet ? i think just reject if req is to connect. use reconnet for reconnect)
3. 





 //    CONCLUSIONS
// no speed EFFECT , on loading FILE from UI, or reading from memory, if enough parallel chunks are doing work. OR EVEN NOT.

//  WHAT SPEED AND CHUNK SHOULD I USE -> 20MB AND 20 PARALLEL

// ok, so we need to know how to balance parallellism, 
// and 2, know if connection is too slow, then move to 5MB Packets.
