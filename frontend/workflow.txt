1. client send ws req (called on ws.open)
2. receive public id.

3. only when see public id, that change screen to waiting for approval
4. when client gets approved, then show main page.

5. Make UI For Uploading Our File
6. Make ui + handle removing Our File

(available files: files coming from server)
7. Make UI for available files 
8. Handle UI When available File Removed
8. Make UI for downloading available files 

9. Handle Download file
10. Handle if alot of files. then you would download n files at a time.

11. Dynamic chunk implement
12. check files before combining

13. Modularization of that mess

14. Implement Upload too.


// ========== REALISTIC WORK I AM DOING RN ========= //

1. ADD APP IN THIS SAME UI USING ENV VAR
2. MAKE FULLLY WORKING APP. [NO WS RECONNECT LOGIC]
2.5 HANDLE SMALL THINGS LIKE FOLDER TRANSFER. [ONLY APP - APP], naming of devices <update + send>
3. IMPORIVE UI [FROM NIGERIA OR CHINA]
4. PORT TO REACT NATIVE []

// CALL VICTOE -> Only Talk About Video and FYP. [MUST BE DONE THIS WEEKEND]


xxx. cleanup of chunks in server. full cleanup after x seconds
xxx. send ack on both sides
xxx. check new file if exist. main issue. new file comes. clientb ask all files. server send them from UI. NOw during this time, if someone also sent something. then it would have same file from UI + itself. kinda issue here.
    fix: save file by file id, or array + check each file.
    fix-better: when sending all files, only then check for duplicates.
        

todo: 
vite.config.js -> remove proxy
app.jsx        -> approved must be false by default

should we do:
1. upload folder possible frombrowser, but caveats. we need to handle it anyways due to app. (only if downloading file is in app).
