1. client send ws req (called on ws.open)
2. receive public id.

3. only when see public id, that change screen to waiting for approval
4. when client gets approved, then show main page.

5. Make UI For Uploading File
6. Make UI for Showing Available Files




todo: 
vite.config.js -> remove proxy
app.jsx        -> approved must be false by default

should we do:
1. upload folder possible frombrowser, but caveats. we need to handle it anyways due to app. (later)
